# TODO: Currently, the python-magic library causes build errors on Windows due to its dependency on DLLs for libmagic.
# We have temporarily disabled this feature on Windows and are using python-magic for Mac OS and Linux instead.
# For more details, see the related GitHub issue.
# Once a solution is found, this should be updated to support Windows as well.
