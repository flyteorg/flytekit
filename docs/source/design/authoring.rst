One of the core features of Flytekit is to enable users to write tasks and workflows. In this section, we will understand how it works internally.

.. note::

    Please refer to the `design doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/17rNKg6Uvow8CrECaPff96Tarr87P2fn4ilf_Tv2lYd4/edit#>`__.

*********************
Types and Type Engine
*********************
Flyte has its own type system, which is codified `in the IDL <https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteidl>`__. Python has its own type system despite being a dynamic language, which is primarily explained in `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`_. Flytekit needs to build a medium to bridge the gap between these two type systems.

Type Engine
=============
This primariliy happens through the :py:class:`flytekit.extend.TypeEngine`. This engine works by invoking a series of :py:class:`TypeTransformers <flytekit.extend.TypeTransformer>`. Each transformer is responsible for providing the functionality that the engine requires for a given native Python type.

*****************
Callable Entities
*****************
:ref:`Tasks <divedeep-tasks>`, :ref:`workflows <divedeep-workflows>`, and :ref:`launch plans <divedeep-launchplans>`  form the core of the Flyte user experience. Each of these concepts is backed by one or more Python classes. These classes in turn, are instantiated by decorators (in the case of tasks and workflow) or a regular Python call (in the case of launch plans).

Tasks
=====
This is the current task class hierarchy:

.. inheritance-diagram:: flytekit.core.python_function_task.PythonFunctionTask flytekit.core.python_function_task.PythonInstanceTask flytekit.extras.sqlite3.task.SQLite3Task
   :parts: 1
   :top-classes: flytekit.core.base_task.Task

Please see the documentation on each of the classes for details.

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.base_task.Task
   :noindex:

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.base_task.PythonTask
   :noindex:

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.python_auto_container.PythonAutoContainerTask
   :noindex:

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.python_function_task.PythonFunctionTask
   :noindex:


Workflows
==========
There are two workflow classes, and both inherit from the :py:class:`WorkflowBase <flytekit.core.workflow.WorkflowBase>` class.

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.workflow.PythonFunctionWorkflow
   :noindex:

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.workflow.ImperativeWorkflow
   :noindex:


Launch Plan
===========
There is only one :py:class:`LaunchPlan <flytekit.core.launch_plan.LaunchPlan>` class.

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.launch_plan.LaunchPlan
   :noindex:

.. exception_handling:

******************
Exception Handling
******************
Exception handling takes place along two dimensions:

* System vs. User: We try to differentiate between user exceptions and Flytekit/system-level exceptions. For instance, if Flytekit fails to upload its outputs, that's a system exception. If the user raises a ``ValueError`` because of an unexpected input in the task code, that's a user exception.
* Recoverable vs. Non-recoverable: Recoverable errors will be retried and counted against the task's retry count. Non-recoverable errors will simply fail. System exceptions are by default recoverable (since there's a good chance it was just a blip).

Here's the user exception tree. Feel free to raise any of these exception classes. Note that the ``FlyteRecoverableException`` is the only recoverable exception. All others, along with all the non-Flytekit defined exceptions, are non-recoverable.

.. inheritance-diagram:: flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteValidationException flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteEntityAlreadyExistsException flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteValueException flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteTimeout flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteAuthenticationException flytekit.common.exceptions.user.FlyteRecoverableException
   :parts: 1
   :top-classes: Exception

Implementation
==============
For those who want to dig deeper, take a look at the :py:class:`flytekit.common.exceptions.scopes.FlyteScopedException` classes.
There are two decorators that are interspersed throughout the codebase.

.. autofunction:: flytekit.common.exceptions.scopes.system_entry_point

.. autofunction:: flytekit.common.exceptions.scopes.user_entry_point

**************
Call Patterns
**************
The above-mentioned entities (tasks, workflows, and launch plan) are callable. They can be invoked to yield a unit (or units) of work in Flyte.

In Pythonic terms, when you add ``()`` to the end of one of the entities, it invokes the ``__call__`` method on the object.

What happens when a callable entity is called depends on the current context, specifically the current :py:class:`flytekit.FlyteContext`

Raw Task Execution
===================
This is what happens when a task is just run as part of a unit test. The ``@task`` decorator actually turns the decorated function into an instance of the ``PythonFunctionTask`` object, but when a user calls the ``task()`` outside of a workflow, the original function is called without any interference by Flytekit.

Task Execution Inside Workflow
===============================
When a workflow is run locally (say as a part of a unit test), certain changes occur in the ``task``.

Before going further, there is a special object that's worth mentioning, the :py:class:`flytekit.extend.Promise`.

.. autoclass:: flytekit.core.promise.Promise
   :noindex:

Let's assume we have a workflow like ::

    @task
    def t1(a: int) -> Tuple[int, str]:
        return a + 2, "world"

    @task
    def t2(a: str, b: str) -> str:
        return b + a

    @workflow
    def my_wf(a: int, b: str) -> Tuple[int, str]:
        x, y = t1(a=a).with_overrides(...)
        d = t2(a=y, b=b)
        return x, d

As discussed in the Promise object's documentation, when a task is called from inside a workflow, the Python native values returned by the raw underlying functions are first converted into Flyte IDL literals and then wrapped inside ``Promise`` objects. One ``Promise`` is created for every return variable.

When the next task is called, the logic is triggered to unwrap these Promises.

Compilation
===========
When a workflow is compiled, instead of producing Promise objects that wrap literal values, they wrap a :py:class:`flytekit.core.promise.NodeOutput` instead. This helps track data dependency between tasks.

Branch Skip
===========
If a :py:func:`flytekit.conditional` is determined to be false, then Flytekit will skip calling the task. This avoids running the unintended task.


.. note::

    We discussed about a task's execution pattern above. The same pattern can be applied to workflows and launch plans too!
