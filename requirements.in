# We need to restrict constrain the versions of both jsonschema and pyyaml because of docker-compose (which is
# used to run integration tests) pins those 2 libraries. We are in the process of removing docker-compose in
# favor of a more generic solution that involves flytectl to stand-up the sandbox, described in
# https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues/1732.
