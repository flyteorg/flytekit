    Please take a look at the comments for :py:class`flytekit.extend.ExecutableTemplateShimTask` as well. This class
    should be subclassed and a custom Executor provided as a default to this parent class constructor
    when building a new external-container flytekit-only plugin.

    This class provides authors of new task types the basic scaffolding to create task-template based tasks. In order
    to write such a task, authors need to

    * subclass the ``ShimTaskExecutor`` class  and override the ``execute_from_model`` function. This function is
      where all the business logic should go. Keep in mind though that you, the plugin author, will not have access
      to anything that's not serialized within the ``TaskTemplate`` which is why you'll also need to
    * subclass this class, and override the ``get_custom`` function to include all the information the executor
      will need to run.
    * Also pass the executor you created as the ``executor_type`` argument of this class's constructor.

    Keep in mind that the total size of the ``TaskTemplate`` still needs to be small, since these will be accessed
    frequently by the Flyte engine.

    * when loading a task, the task that is a loaded is always an ``ExecutableTemplateShimTask``, regardless of what
      kind of task it was originally. It will only ever have what's available to it from the ``TaskTemplate``. No
