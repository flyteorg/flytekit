    """
    This is the function you want to call if you need to specify dependencies between tasks that don't consume and/or
    don't produce outputs. For example, if you have t1() and t2(), both of which do not take in nor produce any
    outputs, how do you specify that t2 should run before t1?

        t1_node = create_node(t1)
        t2_node = create_node(t2)

        t2_node.runs_before(t1_node)
        # OR
        t2_node >> t1_node

    This works for tasks that take inputs as well, say a ``t3(in1: int)``

        t3_node = create_node(t3, in1=some_int)  # basically calling t3(in1=some_int)

    You can still use this method to handle setting certain overrides

        t3_node = create_node(t3, in1=some_int).with_overrides(...)

    Outputs, if there are any, will be accessible. A `t4() -> (int, str)`

        t4_node = create_node(t4)

        in compilation node.o0 has the promise.
        t5(in1=t4_node.o0)

        in local workflow execution, what is the node?  Can it just be the named tuple?
        t5(in1=t4_node.o0)

    @workflow
    def wf():
        create_node(sub_wf)
        create_node(wf2)

    @dynamic
    def sub_wf():
        create_node(other_sub)
        create_node(task)

    If t1 produces only one output, note that in local execution, you still get a wrapper object that
    needs to be dereferenced by the output name.

        t1_node = create_node(t1)
        t2(t1_node.o0)
