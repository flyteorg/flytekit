This is the callback uri registered with the app which handles authorization for a Flyte deployment.
Please note the hardcoded port number. Ideally we would not do this, but some IDPs do not allow wildcards for
the URL, which means we have to use the same port every time. This is the only reason this is a configuration option,
otherwise, we'd just hardcode the callback path as a constant.
FYI, to see if a given port is already in use, run `sudo lsof -i :<port>` if on a Linux system.

- 'basic' This uses cert-based auth in which the end user enters his/her username and password and public key encryption
