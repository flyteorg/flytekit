# Flytekit Snowflake Plugin

Snowflake enables us to build data-intensive applications without operational burden. Flyte backend can be connected with the Snowflake service. Once enabled, it can allow you to query a Snowflake service.

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flytekitplugins-snowflake
```

To configure Snowflake in the Flyte deployment's backend, follow the [configuration guide](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/plugins/webapi/snowflake.html#deployment-plugin-setup-webapi-snowflake).

An [example](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/flytesnacks/examples/snowflake_plugin/index.html) showcasing Snowflake service can be found in the documentation.
