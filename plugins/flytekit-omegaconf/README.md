# Flytekit OmegaConf Plugin

Flytekit python natively supports serialization of many data types for exchanging information between tasks.
The Flytekit OmegaConf Plugin extends these by the `DictConfig` type from the
[OmegaConf package](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/) as well as related types
that are being used by the [hydra package](https://hydra.cc/) for configuration management.

## Task example
```
from dataclasses import dataclass
import flytekitplugins.omegaconf  # noqa F401
from flytekit import task, workflow
from omegaconf import DictConfig

@dataclass
class MySimpleConf:
    _target_: str = "lightning_module.MyEncoderModule"
    learning_rate: float = 0.0001

@task
def my_task(cfg: DictConfig) -> None:
    print(f"Doing things with {cfg.learning_rate=}")


@workflow
def pipeline(cfg: DictConfig) -> None:
    my_task(cfg=cfg)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from omegaconf import OmegaConf

    cfg = OmegaConf.structured(MySimpleConf)
    pipeline(cfg=cfg)
```

## Transformer configuration

The transformer can be set to one of three modes:

`Dataclass` - This mode should be used with a StructuredConfig and will reconstruct the config from the matching dataclass
during deserialisation in order to make typing information from the dataclass and continued validation thereof available.
This requires the dataclass definition to be available via python import in the Flyte execution environment in which
objects are (de-)serialised.

`DictConfig` - This mode will deserialize the config into a DictConfig object. In particular, dataclasses are translated
into DictConfig objects and only primitive types are being checked. The definition of underlying dataclasses for
structured configs is only required during the initial serialization for this mode.

`Auto` - This mode will try to deserialize according to the Dataclass mode and fall back to the DictConfig mode if the
dataclass definition is not available. This is the default mode.

To set the mode either initialise the transformer with the `mode` argument or set the mode of the config directly:

```python
from flytekitplugins.omegaconf.config import SharedConfig, OmegaConfTransformerMode
from flytekitplugins.omegaconf import DictConfigTransformer

# Set the mode directly on the transformer
transformer_slim = DictConfigTransformer(mode=OmegaConfTransformerMode.DictConfig)

# Set the mode directly in the config
SharedConfig.set_mode(OmegaConfTransformerMode.DictConfig)
```

```note
Since the DictConfig is flattened and keys transformed into dot notation, the keys of the DictConfig must not contain
dots.
```
