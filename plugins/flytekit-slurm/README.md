# Flytekit Slurm Plugin

The Slurm agent is designed to integrate Flyte workflows with Slurm-managed high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, enabling users to leverage Slurm's capability of compute resource allocation, scheduling, and monitoring.

This [guide](https://github.com/JiangJiaWei1103/flytekit/blob/slurm-agent-dev/plugins/flytekit-slurm/demo.md) provides a concise overview of the design philosophy behind the Slurm agent and explains how to set up a local environment for testing the agent.
